    "# Final Project - Choosing the Best Pittsburgh Neighborhood\n",

    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "We decided to declare the best Pittsburgh neighborhood as the one that can be most easily traversed without a car. We feel that this metric matters for the sake of the environment and for happier cities. The EPA estimates that vehicles cause almost 75% of the carbon monoxide pollution in the US. This pollution mostly takes place in suburban, completely car dependent areas, but cities like Pittsburgh are still prone to car pollution. Easier and more accessible travel by bikes and walking is important to combat climate change. We decided not to consider public transportation in this metric and instead consider a more narrow definition of car-free travel. Public transportation in Pittsburgh is greatly available in many neighborhoods but not at all in others, leading to a lack of a pattern. \n",
    "\n",
    "Car-free travel in Pittsburgh is measured with three factors:\n",
    "- Walkability is a term that is mainly used to describe the distance from where you live to other amenities, and whether it is within reasonable walking distance.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Bikeability, same as Walkability, is determined by the capability of an area to be traversed by bike \n",
    "\n",
    "- Sidewalk to Street Ratio\n",
    "Using information about different locations and blocks, we can study sidewalk ratings vs. street ratings. The quality of the sidewalks and the rating of the street condition for each block in the city can help us determine the best neighborhood in Pittsburgh. \n",
    "With these three factors, we were able to measure and find the best neighborhoods for our metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Walkability- Sreeha\n",
    "\n",
    "*Introduction*\n",
    "First, I imported pandas and ran through the walkability dataset file I had. Then, I calculated the mean of all the walk scores in the data set, ending up in a score of 42.33\n",

    "### Conclusion\n",
    "The few areas that kept popping up throughout each map that we decided fit our metrics the best. They were Bloomfield, which had a high walk score as well as many POGOH stations and Lower Lawrenceville which actually had the highest number of biking commuters. Both of these destinations scored high across the datasets. After looking at a seperate topographic map of Pittsburgh, we choose Bloomfield as the best neighborhood for its flatness, feeling that this would add to ease of carless travel. \n",
